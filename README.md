While in game you control the Earth with your mouse.
If you have Bombs, you can use them by pressing Spacebar.
A shockwave will then be emitted to destroy all projectiles it hits.

Press Escape while in the game to enter and exit the pause screen.
From there you can also enter the tutorial again by pressing Space.
